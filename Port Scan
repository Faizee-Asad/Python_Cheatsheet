print("\nScanning",target,"for ports 21,22,80,139,443 and 8080...\n")

for port in ports:
  portscan = scan_v.scan(target,str(port))
  print("Port",port," is ",portscan['scan'][list(portscan['scan'])[0]]['tcp'][port]['state'])

print("\nHost",target," is ",portscan['scan'][list(portscan['scan'])[0]]['status']['state'])
